# OIBSIP
### Oasis Infobyte Internship on Python Programming.

#### PROJECT 1 : Basic Weather App**

Description: Develop a graphical weather app with a user-friendly interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt. Enable users to input their location or use GPS for automatic detection. Provide detailed weather data, including current conditions, hourly and daily forecasts, wind speed, and visual elements like weather icons.

Key Concepts and Challenges: API Integration: Connect to a weather API and parse JSON data. User Input Handling: Validate and process user input for location. GUI Design (for Advanced): Create a user-friendly interface with input fields, weather data displays, and visual elements. GPS Integration (for Advanced): Implement location detection if developing a mobile app. Error Handling: Address potential errors during data retrieval or user input. Data Visualization (for Advanced): Display weather data in an appealing manner, possibly using icons or animations. Unit Conversion (for Advanced): Offer unit options for temperature (e.g., Celsius and Fahrenheit).


#### PROJECT 2 : BMI Calculator**

Description: Develop a graphical BMI calculator with a user-friendly interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt. Allow users to input weight and height, calculate BMI, and visualize the result. Enable data storage for multiple users, historical data viewing, and BMI trend analysis through statistics and graphs.

Key Concepts and Challenges: User Input Validation: Ensure valid user inputs within reasonable ranges and handle errors gracefully. BMI Calculation: Accurately implement the BMI formula. Categorization: Classify BMI values into health categories based on predefined ranges. GUI Design (for Advanced): Create an intuitive interface with labels, input fields, and result displays. Data Storage (for Advanced): Implement user data storage, possibly using file storage or a small database. Data Visualization (for Advanced): Visualize historical BMI data with graphs or charts. Error Handling (for Advanced): Address potential issues with data storage or retrieval. User Experience (for Advanced): Ensure a responsive and user-friendly GUI with clear instructions and feedback.


#### PROJECT 3 : Chat Application**

Create a basic text-based chat application in Python where two users can exchange messages in real-time using the command line. Implement a simple client-server model for message exchange.


#### PROJECT 4 : Simple Random Password Generator**

Description: Develop an advanced password generator with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter or PyQt. Enhance it by including options for password complexity, adherence to security rules, and clipboard integration for easy copying.

Key Concepts and Challenges: Randomization: Learn how to generate random characters and strings. User Input Validation: Validate user input for password length and character types. Character Set Handling: Manage different character sets (letters, numbers, symbols). GUI Design (for Advanced): Create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for password generation. Security Rules (for Advanced): Implement rules for generating strong, secure passwords. Clipboard Integration (for Advanced): Allow users to copy generated passwords to the clipboard for convenience. Customization (for Advanced): Enable users to customize password generation further, e.g., excluding specific characters.


#### PROJECT 5 : The Voice Assistant

Description: V-Assi is an AI assistant developed by TIKENDRA. It is here to help you with a wide range of tasks, from general discussion to opening applications, cracking jokes and system management.
